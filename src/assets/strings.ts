      'The University of Manitoba Association of Tiny Tractors (UMATT) is a dynamic student ' +

      'students. Each year, we undertake the exciting challenge of designing, manufacturing, ' +
      'testing a quarter-scale tractor for the ASABE International ¼ Scale Design Competition.',
    content2:
      'As part of UMATT, students immerse themselves in a hands-on learning environment, honing ' +
      'both technical and soft skills in areas of design, manufacturing, and marketing. This ' +
      'experience fosters growth in teamwork, leadership, and project management which ' +
      'complement the theoretical concepts taught in classrooms with practical, real-world ' +
      'application. Members of UMATT are provided invaluable opportunities to acquire both ' +
