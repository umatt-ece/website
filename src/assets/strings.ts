      'The University of Manitoba Association of Tiny Tractors (UMATT) is a dynamic student ' +
      'design group composed of engineering, agriculture, computer science and business ' +
      'students. Each year, we undertake the exciting challenge of designing, manufacturing, ' +
      'testing a quarter-scale tractor for the ASABE International ¼ Scale Design Competition.',
    content2:
      'As part of UMATT, students immerse themselves in a hands-on learning environment, honing ' +
      'both technical and soft skills in areas of design, manufacturing, and marketing. This ' +
      'experience fosters growth in teamwork, leadership, and project management which ' +
      'complement the theoretical concepts taught in classrooms with practical, real-world ' +
      'application. Members of UMATT are provided invaluable opportunities to acquire both ' +
      'technical expertise and gain firsthand experience not attainable within the traditional ' +
      'University setting, preparing them for success after graduation.',

      'students from all over the world to Peoria, Illinois. All teams are given an engine and ' +
      'set of tires to work with, but the rest of the design is left up to the teams to ' +
      'determine. To be successful, teams must prove their proficiency in the following:',

      content: 'Teams must be able to design a tractor that is not only functionally safe, ' +
        'but also performs well. Dynamic events test a tractor’s maneuverability, durability, ' +
        'and power. The apex of every competition is the annual tractor pulls where teams go ' +
        'head-to-head against one another to see who can pull the most weight.'

    manufacturing: {
      title: 'Manufacturing',
      content: 'Teams must be able to design within their given constraints. With limited ' +

        'effectively communicate why their product will succeed over others. Every decision and ' +
        'design choice made must be intentional and justified. Design reports and presentations, ' +
        'judged by industry professionals, make up a significant portion of a team’s overall score.'
